# C++ Tutorial Samples

This repository contains C++ sample codes that I adopted from various sources to instruct an introductory C++ programming course in 2005. These samples try to help the newcomers quickly find an appropriate pattern for solving their problem. Also they can quickly find out how a certain language construct, or a popular function is generally used.

These samples are by no means complete, nor free from errors. Feel free to make them complete or introduce them to more C++ newbies.

To find the most recent modifications of these samples, or to contribute, find their github repository here: <https://github.com/sinairv/CppTutorialSamples> 

## References

Beside several Internet sources, these are the main references that I used during the course of creating these samples. Most of the samples are adopted from the first reference. I strongly recommend studying the first reference, if you are learning C++ as a *first* programming language.
